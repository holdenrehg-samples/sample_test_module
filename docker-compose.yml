    # Port Mapping
    # --------
    #
    # Here we are mapping a port on the host machine (on the left)
    # to a port inside of the container (on the right.) The default
    # port on Odoo is 8069, so Odoo is running on that port inside
    # of the container. But we are going to access it locally on
    # our machine from localhost:9000.
    ports:
      - 9000:8069

    # Data Volumes
    # --------
    #
    # This defines files that we are mapping from the host machine
    # into the container.
    #
    # Right now, we are using it to map a configuration file into
    # the container and any extra odoo modules.
    volumes:
      - ./odoo.conf:/etc/odoo/odoo.conf
      - ./test_module:/mnt/extra-addons/test_module

    # Odoo Environment Variables
    # --------
    #
    # The odoo image uses a few different environment
    # variables when running to connect to the postgres
    # database.
    #
    # Make sure that they are the same as the database user
    # defined in the db container environment variables.

      - PASSWORD=odoo

  # Database Container Service Definition

    # Database Environment Variables
    # --------
    #
    # The postgresql image uses a few different environment
    # variables when running to create the database. Set the
    # username and password of the database user here.
    #
    # Make sure that they are the same as the database user
    # defined in the web container environment variables.
